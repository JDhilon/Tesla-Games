# Premise
- You have been a prisoner in Elonville for quite some time now. However through emperor Tesla's grace, you and other select prisoners have been given a chance at freedom with the Tesla Games! There is no 1st, 2nd 3rd, only a single winner and many losers. Win by either being the first to complete the laps, or by being the last one standing. Can you survive the machinations of The Tesla Games and the other racers? Really? Prove it.

# Features
- Single player mode that has you face against AI racers. Choose the amount of AI to race against and between two daunting tracks. 
- Multiplayer mode for split screen co-op. No Ai racers in this mode, this is a showdown between human racers only.

# Tips and tricks
- Each cybertruck drives identically, racers are seperated based on their skill alone.
- Each cybertruck come equipped with a standard solar Mark II turret, that can be independantly aimed from the vehicles direction.
- Each cybertruck comes with the ability to deploy EMP Caltrop mines, Electrified oil slick and nanite smoke screens. Courtesy of the SpaceX shield system.
  - The caltrops deal heavy damage to other vehicles. Affects AI or human.
  - The oil slick spins the vehicle out, and makes it harder to control the vehicle temporarily. Affects AI or Human.
  - The smoke screen disables your weapon systems both turret and sheild temporarily. Affects AI or human.
- Pickup boxes will appear on the track, afterall the emperor is quite bored and wants to have a show. Red boxes will give you turret ammo, wheras blue boxes allow for a use of the shield system.
- The emperor thought the games as is were too easy, and so through his infinite wisdom has placed versions of the sheild traps throughout the track that can appear at anytime. These look like a redder shade of the normal shield traps, and will **not** affect AI racers. However, they will mercilessly harm any human racer unfortunate to corss them. How's that for shifting the odds in your favour?

Either be the first to complete all the laps, or be the last one standing.
